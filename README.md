# **Random-Walker**

Based on Dan Shiffman *The Nature Of Code* course ! Go check it out on YouTube.

The following web pen, based on the processing language for the web (p5.js), illustrates,
the some basic principles of motion, which the course dives deeper as it progresses. But the
example mainly wants to tackle the following principles:

1. The principle of illusion
2. Randomness
3. Creativity and Art

I won't digress onto all of them, but whenever we try to simulate a nature based event, we should
always ask ourselves, which probability function to approach to make the simulation as veridic as possible. A couple of known approaches are present:

1. Pseudorandomness (like the one used in the example)
2. Gaussian distribution
3. Perlin Noise (smooth randomness)

That is all for the moment c ya all !

**P.S:** Go check Dan Shiffman channel, is great, visual art stuff.
